# Day 07 - Final Project: Hour Distribution from Email Logs

📅 Date: 15 July 2025  
📚 Course: Python for Everybody  
🎓 Module: 7 - Graduation & Final Assignment  
🏁 Status: ✅ Course Completed (Certificate Earned!)

## 💡 What I Did:
- Parsed lines from `mbox-short.txt` to extract hours from timestamps
- Built a histogram using a Python dictionary
- Sorted and printed the distribution of emails sent by hour

## 🧪 Key Concepts:
- File handling (`open()`, reading lines)
- String operations and `.split()`
- Dictionaries and `.get()` method
- Sorting dictionary keys

## 🗂️ Files Included:
- `day07.py` → Final assignment script (Hour Distribution)
- `mbox-short.txt` → Sample dataset
- `README.md` → Description of Day 07 work

## 🌟 Personal Reflection:
This was my last day in the “Python Data Structures” course. I feel more confident working with structured data.  
The graduation video made me proud — this is just the beginning of being **invincible** in coding!
