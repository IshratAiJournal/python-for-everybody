# 📘 Coursera: Using Python to Access Web Data  
## ✅ Module 2 Completed — 18 July 2025, Day 38 of coding

### 📚 What I Learned:
- How to extract numbers from text files using **Regex (`re.findall`)**
- How to **convert extracted strings to integers** and calculate the **sum**
- Reading from `.txt` files using:
  ```python
  with open('filename.txt') as f:
      text = f.read()
  
⚙️ Tech Skills Practiced:
File handling

Regular expressions

Data extraction & transformation

CLI (PowerShell) commands

Troubleshooting file path issues

🧠 Bonus: What I Figured Out
I learned how to run Python scripts using PowerShell:

cd C:\PHCode\UsingPython_WebData\UsingPython_AccessWebData
python sum_numbers.py

cd C:\PHCode\UsingPython_WebData\UsingPython_AccessWebData
python sum_numbers.py

Fixed path errors and understood how Python reads files from the current directory.
🌟 Personal Reflection:
This module made me feel more confident in using real-world data with Python. Running my script and seeing the correct output was so satisfying!
