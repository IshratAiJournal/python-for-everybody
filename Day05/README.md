# Day 05 – Python for Everybody

**Date:** 12 July 2025  
**Invincibility Day:** 32

## Topics to Cover:
- Looping through lists (`for / in`)
- `split()` and `join()` string methods
- Introduction to `open()` and reading files (up next)

## Plan:
- Watch remaining videos in Module 4
- Complete assignment on list traversal
- Start working on file handling examples

## Notes:
I’m noticing how much more natural Python feels now. Dr. Chuck makes learning smooth and joyful. Tomorrow, I aim to explore real-world data reading tasks with files.

## Motivation:
> “Learning to code has rewired how I think. Day by day, line by line.” 💻✨
