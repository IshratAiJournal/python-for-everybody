# Day 04 – Python for Everybody

**Date:** 11 July 2025  
**Invincibility Day:** 31

## Topics Covered:
- Python List Collection Variables
- Indexing and slicing
- Built-in functions: `len()`, `range()`
- List methods: `append()`, `sort()`, `pop()`

## Activities:
- Watched Module 4 videos
- Completed quizzes with full marks (100%)
- Understood list immutability and slicing logic deeply

## Code Samples:
- Practiced list slicing: `my_list[2:4]`
- Understood `list(range(n))` → generates list of integers
- Practiced `list.append(item)` and `list.sort()`

## Reflections:
This was a fun and satisfying day — I loved the feeling of solving list-related problems. The logic is beginning to click even more deeply. I feel **invincible** with every quiz I ace!
