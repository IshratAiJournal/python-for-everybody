# 🌟 Day 08 — Python for Beginners: Subject Line Analysis from Text Files

📅 **Date**: 16 July 2025  
👩‍💻 **Day**: 36 of Coding | Day 08 of Python for Beginners  
📘 **Topic**: Strings, Files & Loops Practice  
🔤 **File Used**: `myfile.txt`

## ✅ What I Practiced Today

Today, I focused on deepening my understanding of:

- 📂 **Reading files** using `with open(...)`
- 🧵 **Looping through lines**
- 📍 **Filtering lines** using `.startswith("Subject:")`
- 🔠 **Converting text to UPPERCASE**
- 🟡 **Counting vowels** in specific lines
- 🔢 **Counting words** using `.split()`
- 🧠 **Combining logic** into clean, readable programs

## 🗂 Python Programs Written

### 1. `subject_line_uppercase.py`
- Prints all lines that start with `"Subject:"` in **uppercase**
- Practiced string methods: `.strip()`, `.startswith()`, `.upper()`

### 2. `vowel_count_subject_lines.py`
- For each `"Subject:"` line, counts how many **vowels** are present
- Built character loop logic using `if char in vowels`

### 3. `subject_line_analysis.py`
- ✅ Most complete program of the day!
- For each `"Subject:"` line:
  - Counts **vowels**
  - Counts **words**
- Tracks and prints **total subject lines found**

## 📄 Sample Input (`myfile.txt`)
