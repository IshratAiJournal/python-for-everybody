# 🚀 Day 03: Conditionals, Functions, and Loops

📅 **Date:** 10 July 2025  Day 30th of Learning Coding
🎓 **Course:** Python for Everybody (Coursera)  
💻 **Day in Coding Journey:** Day 30  


## ✅ Topics Covered Today

- `if`, `else`, `elif` conditionals
- Logical comparisons: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Nested conditionals
- `try` / `except` blocks for error handling
- Creating and using functions with `def`
- Using `return` to send values back from a function
- Indentation rules for conditionals and function blocks
- Loop basics: `while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`
- Using `input()` and converting with `float()` / `int()`


## 🧠 Assignments Completed

### 🔹 3.1 Gross Pay with Overtime
- Prompted user for hours and rate
- Paid 1.5x rate for hours above 40
- Used `if-else` to calculate
- **Tested with 45 hours and 10.50 rate → Output: 498.75**

### 🔹 3.3 Score to Grade Converter
- Used `try` and `except` to handle invalid inputs
- Checked if score is between 0.0 and 1.0
- Assigned grades: A, B, C, D, F
- **Tested with score 0.85 → Output: B**

### 🔹 4.6 Using `computepay()` Function
- Defined a function `computepay(h, r)`
- Logic moved inside function
- Returned result and printed pay outside
- **Output: Pay 498.75**

### 🔹 5.2 Find Largest & Smallest with Input Loop
- Used `while True` to take multiple inputs
- Checked for `"done"` to exit
- Used `try/except` for non-integer input
- Used `None` to track max and min

## ✨ Reflection (13-year-old version)

Today was so much fun! I learned how to make smart decisions in code using if-else, and also how to create my own functions.
I made the computer do real math based on what the user typed! I also learned how to keep asking the user for input and how to stop when they say "done".
I got 100% in all my quizzes — yay me! Day by day every day I am getting INVINCIBLE🎉
